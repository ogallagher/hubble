# Hubble
A webgame host written 99% in JS, using the p5 libraries for structure and visuals. It's set up to be mobile-device friendly and an easy platform for game developers to self-publish and for players to play!

# To Do
- [x] category icon
- [x] help icon

- [x] use window.prompt() for search

        - [x] in response to searched (name,tag) game additions
        - [x] in response to /featured game additions
        - [x] #.fill is determined by numStars OR account.reviews
            - [x] numStars = bubble.label.name if (bubble.link == “/rate” && this.focused)

        - [x] if address == "", prompt for the user to register or log in on select()

            - [x] fix alterations of game.rating and account.reviews. The former appends as a string, and the latter doesn’t seem to change at all -> I think the query’s JSON wasn’t parsed correctly server-side

    - [x] change bubble.displayText()
- [x] add more games that are mobile-compatible and more varied in type
- [x] server.addGame() function:
    - [x] add to games.byName lexicographically
    - [x] add to games.byRating according to current game.rating

- [x] fix display of bubble.label.name
    - [x] create client-wide and mobile-wide variable: hovering
    - [x] hovering = true, if (distance(bubble,cursor) lessthan bubble.size*0.5 && touches.length lessthan 0)
    - [x] background darkens
    - [x] increase circumference for bubble.label.name display
    - [x] create bubble.touched variable (to see which bubble is activating hovering)
    - [x] other bubbles darken
- [x] server: fix search functions to not return repeat games
- [x] category icons
    - [x] version
    - [x] multiplayer
    - [x] racing
    - [x] strategy
    - [x] action
    - [x] puzzle
    - [x] adventure
- [x] if bubble.label.name is too long, show until NAME_MAX

    - [x] the above categories are stored in an info (i) bubble’s dialogue box
- [x] sometimes passwords won’t save correctly and aren’t recognized by the server upon login...
- [x] client: move cursor to center after release in select() function
- [x] client: move cursor to corner if bubble.link is a text box... too difficult to implement; not worth the trouble
